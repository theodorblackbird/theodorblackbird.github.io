# Théodor Lemerle
## PhD Student @ IRCAM, team _Analyse/Synthèse_.
My goal is to build expressive text-to-speech model that could convincingly tell a story to a kid. 

Before that I studied acoustic, signal processing and computer science for
music ([ATIAM](https://www.atiam.ircam.fr/en/)) at IRCAM. I also studied mathematics and computer science
at Sorbonne Université ([M2A](https://m2a.lip6.fr/)).

My supervisors are [Axel Roebel](https://www.ircam.fr/person/axel-roebel) and [Nicolas Obin](https://www.ircam.fr/person/nicolas-obin).

## I'm interested in 

Text-to-speech, deep learning, audio signal processing, generative modeling ...
