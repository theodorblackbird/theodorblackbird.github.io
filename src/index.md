# Théodor Lemerle
## 1st year PhD Candidate @ IRCAM, team _Analyse/Synthèse_.
My goal is to build expressive text-to-speech model so that it 
could convincigly tell a story to a kid. 

Before that I was studying acoustic, signal processing and computer science for
music (see [ATIAM](https://www.atiam.ircam.fr/en/)) at IRCAM. I also studied mathematics and computer science
at Sorbonne Université (check [M2A](https://m2a.lip6.fr/)).

My supervisors are [Axel Roebel](https://www.ircam.fr/person/axel-roebel) and [Nicolas Obin](https://www.ircam.fr/person/nicolas-obin).

## I'm interested in 

Text-to-speech, deep learning, audio signal processing, generative modelling ...
